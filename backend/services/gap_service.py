## Complications

### Intraoperative Complications
- Hemorrhage: Most common, can occur from cortical vessels or tumor bed
- Vascular injury: Damage to major vessels requires immediate repair
- Air embolism: Risk when operating in sitting position

### Postoperative Complications
- Cerebral edema: Manage with steroids and osmotic agents
- Infection: Prophylactic antibiotics, monitor for signs
- Seizures: Consider prophylactic anticonvulsants
- CSF leak: May require revision surgery

### Neurological Deficits
- Motor weakness: Typically improves with time and rehabilitation
- Sensory changes: Usually temporary
- Cognitive changes: Monitor and provide supportive care

### Long-term Considerations
- Tumor recurrence monitoring with serial imaging
- Rehabilitation and quality of life
- Psychological support
