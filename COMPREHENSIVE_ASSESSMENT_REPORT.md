## 🤖 AI Services Assessment

### Multi-Provider Integration: ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

#### Provider Support & Fallback Chain:
1. **Primary:** Claude 3 (Opus/Sonnet) - Best for medical synthesis
2. **Secondary:** GPT-4/GPT-4 Turbo - Reliable fallback
3. **Tertiary:** Gemini 1.5 Pro - PDF processing optimized
4. **Mock Mode:** Always available - realistic responses without API keys

#### Graceful Degradation Pattern:
```python
# Verified fallback implementation:
- API timeout → Switch to faster model
- Rate limit → Exponential backoff + queue
- No API key → Mock responses
- Network error → 3x retry with backoff
```

### AI Task Optimization:
- **Synthesis:** Claude 3 → GPT-4 → Mock
- **Q&A Simple:** GPT-3.5 → Gemini Flash → Mock
- **Q&A Complex:** GPT-4 → Claude 3 → Mock
- **PDF Processing:** Gemini 1.5 → GPT-4 Vision → Mock
